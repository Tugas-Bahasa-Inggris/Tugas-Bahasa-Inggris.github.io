I will tell you about my experience when I was in middle school
When I entered school Middle  I was very nervous about going in but I was told by my friend to have the courage to go to middle school and I took the courage and I finally had the courage to go to school.And I finally started to get used to the school 

That was my experience when I entered junior high school</p>
